<p>Hi, I'm Hannah. I make things.</p>

<h4>Circular Dependency</h4>

<p>My intent is to create a website that will allow me to document the things that I am learning through, well, creating this website.</p>
<p>Once it is up and running I believe that it will expand to become a portfolio of my work ('work' is a broad term here - web development work, photographic work, musical work, woodwork, etc.). As you may or may not have noticed, I make things. All manner of things.</p>
